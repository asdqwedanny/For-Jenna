                <p>Dear Jenna,</p>
                <p>Hi baby, today is your birthday and our first anniversary. I was about to talk about how I made this website but let's just focus on the birthday thing. HEHE. It's been a year since we have dated. I'm so glad and fortunate enough to meet such a wonderful person and dated her. In this special day, I just want to show my appreciation and tell you how much I love you. I am so happy that we can be together. And thank you for always be there no matter good or bad. It always warms me whenever you comforts me when I am down. It feels like that seeing you would be the solution to everything. It gives me courage to continue what I am doing, knowing that there's always a person behind supporting me.</p>
                <p>I would also like to say how much I love you. When I think about you all the time, the only things that would come to my mind is how to make you ever happier now and in the future. I want to try my best to make you the happiest person in the world and that we could live happily together. I love you so much baby. Now that I have you fill in every corner in my life and I feel so thankful for that and would never want to lose it. That's just how much I love spending time with you and how much I truly love you. I love you baby, and wish you a very happy birthday. And hopefully I can be there with you for the rest of the birthday in your life.</p>
                <p>Love, Danny</p>
